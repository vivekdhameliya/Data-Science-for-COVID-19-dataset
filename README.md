# Collecting COVID-19-dataset
## Experiments from the book of data science with COVID-19 dataset

* On December 31, 2019, the WHO was informed of an outbreak of “pneumonia of unknown cause” detected in Wuhan City, 
Hubei Province, China – the seventh-largest city in China with 11 million residents. As of January 23, 
there are over 800 cases of 2019-nCoV confirmed globally, including cases in at least 20 regions in China 
and nine countries/territories. The first reported infected individuals, some of whom showed symptoms as early
as December 8, were discovered to be among stallholders from the Wuhan South China Seafood Market. Subsequently, 
the wet market was closed on Jan 1. The virus causing the outbreak was quickly determined to be a novel coronavirus. 
On January 10, gene sequencing further determined it to be the new Wuhan coronavirus, namely 2019-nCoV, a betacoronavirus,
related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus 
(SARS-CoV). However, the mortality and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV are still unknown, and likely to vary from 
those of the prior referenced coronaviruses.

* Currently, Many universities and data scientists applying Machine learning algorithms and statistics knowledge to find correlation among data, predicting the deaths, new infections, and so on. There are many opensource COVID-19 datasets are available, which have updated information on a daily basis.
